Gender Flexibility, But Not Equality: Young Adults' Division of Labor Preferences
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Sociologists [Brittany Dernberger](https://twitter.com/bdernberger) and [Joanna Pepin](https://twitter.com/CoffeeBaseball) use nearly 40 years of survey data to show that young people are more open to an array of division of labor arrangements but continue to prioritize women’s time at home and men’s time at work.

An open access version of the study is available on SocArXiv: https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/q846y/
